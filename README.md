# Projet 3A

Repository for the third year project that I am doing with Dr. Remi Monasson at ENS, Paris. 

We are working towards understanding the robustness of the specificity of the binding of certain ligands to  PDZ domains in the mouse genome. 

The structure of the code is as follows:

1. **Read PDZ Domain Data.ipynb** : Python notebook to read and understand the data for the first time.
2. **PDZ 2.ipynb**: Python notebook where I have written bits and pieces of the Monte-Carlo simulations that we hoped to do
